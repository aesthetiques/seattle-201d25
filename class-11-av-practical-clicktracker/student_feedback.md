# Student Feedback - Week 02

## In general, how would you describe your past week?

- Extremely rewarding but extremely challenging. The first two days were really tough and I had a lot of internal questions over my choice to pursue this whole programming / web dev thing. But thankfully the rest of the week was a little more low key in terms of extreme brain usage and those questions subsided as I started to figure things out.
- I made it through the week, so that is a plus. It was rough. I slept very little and accomplished too few of the aspects of the problem domains given for the cookie-stand project. In general it was rough. On the plus, I learned a lot.
- I rate the value of it very high, 9/10. But the enjoyment of the week was very low, 2/3, so I'd say that balances out to about a 6. It was very much a rollercoaster of emotion and learning.
- This was the most crazy week - completely had my brain melt. When it finally solidified I experienced the 'Aha' moment and had the most amazing breakthrough that has totally changed the way I approach coding. Like WOW!
- The Salmon Cookies was a challenging way to introduce the entire class to new Java Script element ID which I guess is the starting block for jquery; many many different concepts were introduced and are still boondoggling in my mind. I want to tell Pat to close all his stores down in Seattle and move somewhere else.
- It was a great week, much better than expected. The concepts from week one are finally taking root and I'm able to build on them.
- I love this school and I love these people.

## Which aspects of the course have been least helpful?

- I would be nice if the TA's could be a bit more clear in telling students when to completely scrap a project. I know it can be difficult telling a student to completely start over, but it would have saved me a lot of time if a TA just came out and told me that I should completely restart, rather than dancing around the subject.
- The TAs seem to be quite unavailable in the afternoons during lab time when we need them. I understand they are grading papers and busy but when there's only 1-2 of them around for only a few hours before 5 pm it means a lot of us don't get the assistance we'd like.
- I understand that "more CSS" (not from me) was feedback from last week, but I feel our time would be better spent on more of the logic and looping theory/concepts/problem solving. We have limited time and should basis towards "biggest bang" for our instructional hour.
- One small issue - assignments are generally graded off the pull request, but sometimes we have to merge. When several days go by before these assignments are graded, there can be confusion about which version is being graded.
- This week I did not find code demos as consistently helpful. There were times that I could follow along well and other times that I lost where we were all of a sudden and couldn't pick up the train of thought again. I think it is because the material was less familiar to me than last week and so it took me more time to process the reasoning, which got me lost in terms of the conversation.
- Watching the 401 presentations. It was inspiring to see what the end results of this program will be, but i felt at this point in the course a lot of what was being showcased; particularly the back end; was over our heads. I would have rather of had more lecture or lab time with the TAs and prof Nick

## Which aspects of the course have been most helpful?

- Code review, especially when the instructor picks on a broke ass web-page from my class-mates and then as a class we fix it and make it a good lookin' one!
- Instructors have all been helpful and friendly. The partner programing has been very useful as well.
- Working with other students to solve problems. I cant wait for the group projects. The TA's have also been extremely helpful.
- Code reviews and walking through the code line by line. Also watching the 401 students present their end of course projects was inspiring to see where we can be in a few months (after many nights and grit of course). The CSS assignments and CSS extra credit are a welcome addition to assignment loads.
- The hard & fast-paced learning style. It forces me to learn it. Code Review is extremely helpful as well.
- Brain's help this week was great - Thanks Brain. Code reviews and the day we as a team built the HW from the ground up were all highlights of the week. Oh, and Brain was great.
- During the middle of the week I saw a shift in the amount of classmates that were able to grasp the concepts early on most of the students helped other students out. Several of the TAs like Brandon were able to guide me in the right direction.
- Instructional teams unwavering support both in coding and in mental/emotional capacities.
- Nick's feedback and explanations during code review have been the most helpful. He is clear, concise and to the point.

## Do you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns?

- I understand that this is a "boot camp", but I believe that reiteration is a very important aspect of learning. It seems that a majority of the lecture being taught is a lot of filler material. But the material we actually need to know, we power through in a half an hour. And I, like many other people, cannot retain information THAT quickly. I feel like I learn more after class, when we turn to our projects. Not as much when we're in class.
- The turn backs on the 'Great Coding Expedition' are demoralizing. But this is part of the process, just have to believe that it will get better as we learn more.
- Deadlines for before project week has me extremely concerned and stressed about overall grades especially coming into week 3 still behind in lab work.
- My only (mostly mild) concern is that I don't have enough knowledge yet to build an interesting project during the fourth week. I'm also a little concerned by Karinne's comment about there being no hand-holding after 201, since I'm not sure what exactly that means in terms of getting clarification/guidance from the instructional team.
- At this time the only concern I have is that my resubmitted assignments get graded in time. If it turns out that I need to do even further work to get the scores I want but time has run out because I was waiting for over a week to hear about a resubmitted assignment, I will be very upset.

## Do you have any additional candid feedback regarding your instructional team?

- We consistently go so far over class time (until 1pm or later) that it's causing several issues. The lunch hour is the only time I can get any business hours stuff done, and I haven't been able to schedule anything reliably. I count on that hour to make doctor appointments and important phone calls. We also ended up completely missing the admissions team's office hours. If we could break for lunch consistently and then come back to the classroom for any additional instruction after lunch it would be really helpful.
- Nick has been really open to feedback from the class, and is really adaptive. He really cares that we understand the information he is teaching. <3 Nick gets a heart too!!!
- As the week progressed in the code review that we used help instill progress. I enjoyed , learned, and realized that many of my fellow class mates were struggling to achieve ten different concepts at once.
- Keep up the hard work, as hard as it is for me; it is imaginably hard to support people while also have a job to do grading and other things. I not only appreciate the much-needed help and work with the instructional team, I respect the massive responsibility taken on for Code Fellows and the students.
- Brian is a tremendous TA. His passion for helping students is a boon to the experience.
- I think we took too long of a break on Friday, and it felt like we lost half of the day.
- Nick rules. I love being in this class.
