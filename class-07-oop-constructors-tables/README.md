- [Review of Yesterday](#codereview)

*10-minute break*

- [Constructor functions](#code)

*10-minute break*

- [HTML Tables](#tables)

- [Lab overview](#lab)

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 7 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to translate an object literal into a constructor function, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Be able to use the ‘prototype’ property to extend the inheritable properties and methods of a constructor function, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Be able to dynamically build an HTML table with JavaScript and render it to the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment

## Readings

- HTML Chapter 6: "Tables"
- JS Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)

## Code Review

We'll start today with Sam just building out a solution to yesterday. You'll get a lot of insight into process and also into some of the details.

## Constructor Functions

We'll look at how to build constructor functions from object literals and talk about some large-scale design issues relating to this week's project.

## HTML Tables

**HTML Chapter 6: "Tables"**

- p.131: Basic table structure
- p.132: Table headings
- p.133: Spanning columns & rows
- We'll also take a look at how to build HTML tables dynamically with JavaScript
