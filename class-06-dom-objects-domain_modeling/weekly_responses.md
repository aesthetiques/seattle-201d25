# Week 1 Survey Responses

## Which aspects of the course have been least helpful?

- The readings can be great at times, though I don't pick up topics in this manner as well as learning through lecture and practicing the subjects.
- Youtube recording, if some labeling could be added into the description section of the videos describing when each section starts
- Some of the reviews of the reading in class have been basic and just seem like we are re-reading the book. That being said I know some people didn't do as much pre-work as me nor had the same exposure as me to HTML and CSS before CF so I can understand why it is necessary.
- The lecture in the morning can be very boring and isn't super helpful for in terms of learning.
- journals. I think it's just a personal opinion though it likely is helping in some fashion as a person with an extremely tight schedule to get work done here it eats up precious time. TED talk responses are an entirely thrilling and can be time-consuming as well. I personally like them but again little time and not enough time to do it.
- need to have more css homework.
- I have a hard time learning right out of a book, so the daily readings have only served as a warm-up for the lecture and assignments.
- Sometimes there are things from the book which are contradicted in class. I know that some of this is because the book is older and things have changed, but sometimes it just seems to be stylistic differences between the instructor and book author. It's annoying to get conflicting information about what we're supposed to do. (Example - some HTML tags and the way they should / shouldn't be used.)

## In general, how would you describe your past week?

- Due to time constraints that are completely my fault, I struggled a bit to keep up. I have taken care of those constraints over the weekend and look forward to a better week ahead.
- I rate it a ten, not because the experience is pleasant, but because the experience has been better than expected. I have learned to think differently through problems and road-blocks.
- What i mean is a 9 out of 10 on the "i am so stressed scale" but this is normal in an immersive program, so I totally expected this.
- This past week started off good. It started off as review learning about all the things about git hub.
- 5 looks mid-range, but it's not. It's an average of very high and very low. The lows are mostly my life, and the fact that it's very difficult to deal with anything happening in it while doing the course, and the highs are the course itself.
- While it's been a roller coaster of "I've got this" and "What the **** am I doing?", it's been an amazing start on an amazing journey.
- Intense, challenging, exhausting, and exciting.
- Tiring yet satisfying
- Lack of sleep and surmounting stress really is the only thing accounting for a lower score.
- It's been a humongous week, I have learned so much in such a short period of time. It's been really productive and I couldn't have asked for anything better.
- So far I'm really enjoying it. I really liked the pair programming project, and I'm finding the JavaScript pretty straightforward.

## If you didnâ€™t answer with a 9 or 10, what could we have done differently to earn your referral?

- I'd say I'm on the way to a recommendation, but want another week to be able to give friends the complete picture.
- I think it's too early to have an extreme opinion, either positive or negative.
- I just don't have enough experience with the course to know for sure whether or not I would recommend it. This learning style is not for everyone. I think there should be a little more explanation of key things like "git" rather than the "go figure it out" approach.

## Which aspects of the course have been most helpful?

- TA; some TA from evening classes who come early do provide help as well.
- Code review in the morning helps me understand and learn new things.
- Instructors have been both friendly and helpful whenever I was stuck on a problem. All of the assignments are clearly laid out both on canvas and on GitHub. It's great that the lectures are recorded so that we can go back and watch something again if we forget or don't understand.
- The student comaraderie is really high. I think that has a lot to do with how the expectations were set in the beginning, i.e. the very first presentation on day one.
- The most helpful parts have been code reviews and the partner lab.
- The most helpful have been the fellow students. This is a great group- I would work with any of them. We all have our strengths and are tapping into each other.
- Part of the online tutorials in the pre-work. It didn't dawn until I started to perform projects about how they all tie in together.
- The teacher, TAs, other students, staff, and the learning environment have all been wonderful
- I am learning how to learn.
- Nick is awesome! He is great at explaining things very clearly, and I like his teaching style a lot. Code review is very helpful, and the TAs being around to help in afternoon is super crucial.
- Having to work with GitHub and use branches/do merges/ etc. Just when you think you've got it all figured out you break everything. So lots of practice is good. Partner coding was also helpful (and lots of encouraged collaboration in general) because talking through concepts really helps solidify the material. Lab time is awesome and having Nick, TAs, and fellow students available to help is fantastic!
- I enjoy code reviews because it forces everyone to look line by line at other people's code. Not only does it force us to identify mistakes and talk through an explanation of unfamiliar code, but it allows us to see the different ways people approached their code.

## Do you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns?

- 5-10 min one to one session with the instructor to discuss progress and tips for improvement.
- I have a suggestion for improvement- I think instructions for assignments aren't always the most clear as it seems half of the instructions are on canvas, half on github and sometimes half on slack. It would be nice if all of that would be in the same place.
- I would have appreciated to have a little more knowledge /and practice about functions, html, and css.
- in the class when you are demo-ing css, instead of deleting prior code which i find useful, i would suggest you just comment it out so we can refer to it later.

## Do you have any additional candid feedback regarding your instructional team?

- Nick is awesome, goes a little fast sometimes but always gives ample time for question.
- Team has been great so far. Nick does a great job of taking the readings that we go over and turning them into examples. He answers all questions and makes sure that we know what he is talking about. The TAs have done a good job of chiming in with helpful comments during class and being available for help during the lab portion. Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable, no complaints here.
- I don't like how quickly the instructional team accepts defeat when a student asks how to do something on windows. I think as an instructor one should be willingly to help and look up the answer even if its a question about a different OS (heck I'm a mac-only user as well). Or if the instructional team doesnt have the support to help coders learn on windows, then perhaps applicants should be told CF is a mac-only environment.
- This is like an advanced class, and everything revolves on how resourceful you can be as an individual. Sometimes it's hard to follow when the visual is switching up so fast that my brain can't recognize it. A pause would be really useful, I know that Nick knows what he is doing, but his thoughts are two steps ahead of the visual. I personally need more time to process. I am extremely frustrated with the git tutorial which has only some of the commands we use- and it has been explained over and over- but they are using the same words to describe multiple processes. I a a step one, step two, thinker. All I want to do is do the commands in step order on my terminal, and the git process in step order at the Git Hub. It does me NO good to have people tell me that I better learn the process and figure it out- because right now I have a mess of branches on my computer that need to merge somehow. Brian is going to meet me- because it can't be explained in slack - Oh , yes and Brian is AMAZING but you already know that <3
- Its a compressed course into a month, I understand that lots of information needs to be passed and given, but I'm attempting to press and just push up projects and work that is not done well. I guess part of it is being pressed but at the same time I understand its a healthy pressure.
- Nick has been great. Most of the TA's have been extremely helpful.
- Nick and the TAs are all awesome! I really like how candid they are and how they don't give you the correct answer right away when you have a problem. They'll work with you and guide you to the answer, but you've got to do the work yourself. Special shoutout to the TAs for always making the rounds to help during lab!
- I do not like to be talked to in a remotely patronizing way. Telling me where or how to find something or do something is more than fine, however, telling me 'I should have seen it' or 'you a figure it out if you read such and such' after I have spent time attempting that very thing is assuming I haven't taken the effort. I get that attention to detail is extremely important but I can be told it without 'well you coulda figured it out on your own if....' after I asked for help.
- Nick is awesome. At first I wondered if his brevity was a lack of interest, but now I think he cares and is pushing us hard and want us to succeed.
